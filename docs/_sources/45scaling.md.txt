## Scaling - more to come 
- integrate with processing production in class

## pure simple threads scaling 101

## docker swarm - nice

## kubernetes k8s - only if you have lots of time to learn k8s or k3s

## Pangeo and Dask - promising

### Installation

```

pip install --user dask

pip install --user bokey

ssh tunnel port 8787 for dask console (uses bokeh)

```

## AWS Batch - I really like this 
- but it is AWS specific.
