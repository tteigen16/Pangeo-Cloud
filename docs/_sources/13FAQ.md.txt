# FAQ Frequently Asked Questions

- How do I integrate my Desktop Tools - ARC and QGIS with the cloud?
	- Its not easy - Tony and Rich (and others) are working on solutions
	- You can sample data and selectively xfer it to your desktop or netapp
	- we need to build better dashboards in the cloud - I think they are coming - but this has to be addressed for science adoption of the cloud
	- we will explore some of the ways you mitigate this cloud/desktop integration deficiency in this class

	

- What is the difference between a mini-pangeo and pangeo.usgs.gov?
	- mini-pangeo
		- project based
		- comes with a read write bucket
		- comes with Tony for custom devops and training
		- user group is project specific
		- emphasis on pure docker - simpler
		- costs directed at the projects budget

	- 
	- PANGEO.usgs.gov
		- managed service
		- scalable
		- great for Landsat Collection-2 exploitation
		- dask based
		- kubernetes based
		- docker based
		- great for pure jupyter training
		- sponsored environment

- I assume we can use R in the notebooks as well?

	- yes you can use R 
	- however my focus will be on **python**
	- we may have to have a splinter group that does R 
	- Pete was considering mandating python learning.


# Ideas

- Work on a joint dashboard project with Alemayehu 
-  Roger Auch would be a good one to work with. He has pages of speadsheets, 
	- great for a case study using pandas  dataframe automations!
	- we also have a huc-12 spreadsheet that could be pandas and a direct viz app as well.
- take the student notbook and add another class based on snow-white and the 7 dwarfs - then rework as a dashboard to illustrate apps for the jupyter-shy tribe.
