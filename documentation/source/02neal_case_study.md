# Neal's Case Study

## A month in the life a new cloud scientist

## Project Overview

Neal is the lead scientist for a group of folks ... yada yada yada
- Neal has been using GEE and has been "Motivated" to use CHS. :-)

1. Study evaporation in a 10 degree by 10 degree AOI in the Delaware River Basin (drb)
	- Neal wants to review the ET project and apply lessons learned albeit on an accelerated path
2. Study changes in permafrost in Alaska


## Constraints
- must use CHS AWS

## Stakeholders

- Danny Howard
- Bruce Wylie


## Project Success Recipe
- take one scientist with science problem/model
- fold in one cloud Sherpa
- add one cloud computer and one cloud bucket
- bring to rapid boil
- let stand and enjoy with German chocolate and dark red wine.


## Neal's Project Plan and WBS

### Project Setup and Conceptualizing

### Project Initiation - Neal
1. Develop Charter
2. Get Staffing Aligned
3. Initial low cost base infrastructure
	- compute - basic webserver and admin box - devops
	- storage - just planning at this stage
4. Apply for a CHS Custom Environment and Account [AWS Cloud] 
	- Using Randy Sunne's process = some approval gates will happen **sigh** 
	- mapped to my projects budget - however that accounting stuff works

### Project Simple View

#### Infrastructure Devops - Tony
- create github `new` repo `always begin with a fresh github repo`
- create web host
	- create website  `- DONE!!!`
	- create kanboard `- WIP!!!`
- create mini-pangeo - to be done in CLASS `- WEEK 1`
	- add users from student/neal's team list
		- https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tonybutzer/harmony/blob/main/class/06-Instructor/01-Students.ipynb
	- post mini-pangeo instructions with usernames and password harmony
		- warn users about the ephemeral nature of the cloud
		- github is your friend
			- use any repository you feel comfortable
			- does repository rhyme with suppository?

### Veget Project drb 10 degree tile
### Define AOI
- shapefiles
- geojson files
- visualize AOI on a map
### Data Inputs
### Data List
- Public - pre-wrangled ARD Data Sets
- NetAPP Local Assets to be pushed
	- precipitaion
	- MODIS NDVI
	- temperature
	- more to come ...

## Project Strategy

- cloud immersive strategy - imposed by Tony Butzer
	- unique - because its a cattle versus pets approach
	- ephemeral - sounds scary - you mean things evaporate
	- github suddenly becomes even more important
	- does the name Pavlov ring a bell?
- use self documenting code for everything - "yeah right"
