#### Speculative Generality

- Can/should we move this flavor of code to the attic - Gabe,Tony ?

### Code Refactoring

### Best Practices

### 

### Github Repo

## Author

Darin.Schulte@colostate.edu

This is to introduce you to Dr. Darin  Schulte (CCed).  Darin has the VegET Python  GEE code on Github. He will share the site next week.

For now, please exchange notes and collaborate as you see fit to advance the implementation of VegET on the Pangeo framework. This is an exciting step towards integrating land cover and hydrologic modeling.


## Collaboration Obstacles

CHS is only available inside the USGS networks of VPN Access

### Mitigations

1. Credential every collaborator
2. ```Replicate``` a smaller set of data and aux data into GA buckets for refining/rewriting code to use xarrays
3. Then deploy this in CHS with the known CHS caveats
